# Startup school

Most important things:

- Write Code
- Talk to users

## Talk to Users

5 great questions:

- Whats is the hardest path about [doing something]? (identify problems)
- Tell me about the last time that you encountered that problem? (frecuency)
- Why was this hard? (most important problems?, how to marked the solution)
- What, if anythong, have you done to solve this problem? (is the person alredy trying to solve the problem?)
- What dont you love about the solutions that you've tried? (maybe the first features)

Then, talk to friends and identify first possible users. For that, in excel:

- 3 cols(ROI, Frequency, Budget)
- Rows per first possible customer

Also, find numerical answers to:

- How much does the problem cost to solve?
- How frequent is the problem?
- How large is their budget?

## How to measure market fit?

**Ask once per week/month: How would you feel if you could no longer use "YOUR PRODUCT"?**
(Very disappointed, Somewhat disappointed, Not disappointed)

40% should answer very disappointed

> Remember to discard bad data

## MVP

First goal of a pre-launch startup: Launch very quickly!

- Get initial customers

Ask:

- *Don't fall in love with your MVP!*
- And always ask: Is the MVP solving the problem that I want to solve?
