# Startup school

Most important things:

- Write Code
- Talk to users

## Talk to Users

5 great questions:

- Whats is the hardest path about [doing something]? (identify problems)
- Tell me about the last time that you encountered that problem? (frecuency)
- Why was this hard? (most important problems?, how to marked the solution)
- What, if anythong, have you done to solve this problem? (is the person alredy trying to solve the problem?)
- What dont you love about the solutions that you've tried? (maybe the first features)

Then, talk to friends and identify first possible users. For that, in excel:

- 3 cols(ROI, Frequency, Budget)
- Rows per first possible customer

Also, find numerical answers to:

- How much does the problem cost to solve?
- How frequent is the problem?
- How large is their budget?

*How to measure market fit?*

**Ask once per week/month: How would you feel if you could no longer use "YOUR PRODUCT"?**
(Very disappointed, Somewhat disappointed, Not disappointed)

40% should answer very disappointed

- Optimizing wrong metrics

#### Real progress

To deliver real value to user

- Talking to users
- Building product/service

#### Impact on weekly goal

For each task, prioritize per week, by impact and complexity:

Impact values: High, Medium, Low
Complexity values: Easy(one day), Medium(2-3 days), Hard(Many days/weeks)

**Focus on** High/easy, High/Medium
**Avoid** Low/hard, Low/Medium

Weeklys:

- Primary KPIs(Actual vs goal)
- Biggest obstable to growth

## MVP

First goal of a pre-launch startup: Launch very quickly!

- Get initial customers
- Get feedback from customers
- Iterate

Ask:

- What do I need to launch in X weeks?
- Write a plan
- Cut your plan
- *Don't fall in love with your MVP!*
- And always ask: Is the MVP solving the problem that I want to solve?
